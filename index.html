    <h2 style="color: red;">My Five favorite Movies</h2>
    <ol>
        <li style="color: blue;"><b>Vincenzo</b></li>
        <p>Vincenzo is a K-drama movie series about a mafia lawyer called <em style="color: red;">VINCENZO CASSANO</em> that returns to Korea 
            to retrieve 15 tons of gold that was hidden away by a client of his but was already dead.
            It's a very interesting and fascinating movie. I am currently watching it for the second time and each episode still amazes me.
        </p>
        <li style="color: blue;"><b>Weight lifting fairy</b></li>
        <p>This is another K-drama series movie that has swept me up my feet. It's a romantic, comedy genre. 
            It's about a girl that enjoys lifting weight since she was little. The movie talks about what talented and skilled students go through 
            to be at the top. It's a very interesting movie for me though.
        </p>
        <li style="color: blue;"><b>Pent House</b></li>
        <p>Pent House is a K-drama 3-seasons series movie. This movie has romantic, Comedy, Action, deception and so on... 
            I was deceived so many times in the movie (laughs). It's about a group of high class parents that wants the best for their children academically and otherwise. They don't 
            mind causing other poor people damage just to make their chidren the best. You just cant't stop watching when you start.
        </p>
        <li style="color: blue;"><b>Alchemy of souls</b></li>
        <p>Alchemy of souls is a K-drama series movie. It trended last year but i just got to watch it this year.
            It's an ancient time movie that's about power and soul shifting. Its interesting in its own way.
        </p>
        <li style="color: blue;"><b>Love Contract</b></li>
        <p>Love contract is a K-drama series movie about a lady that marries men on contract. She marries men for a specific period of time legally then files for a divorce after the period 
            is over and gets divorced. She got married to a judge that always judges her case for this same reason but for the judge, he was lonely. This was how she fell in love. It's a romantic 
            movie. I love it too.</p>
